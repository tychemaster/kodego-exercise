            <h2>Bitcoin hits lowest level since June 2022</h2>
            <p><i><strong>Source: </strong>https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/07/bitcoin-btc-price-falls-as-cryptocurrency-market-drops-below-1-trillion-.html</i>
            </p>
            <p>Bitcoin traded below $19,000 on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level since June following a drop in stock markets globally and the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
                The value of the entire cryptocurrency market also fell below $1 trillion as digital coins across the board saw a sell-off.
                Policy tightening by the Fed has strengthened the U.S. dollar which has weighed on risk assets.
                Bitcoin has traded in correlation to stocks and so if equities fall, in general, so does the cryptocurrency.</p>
            <h2>Ether, ADA Lead Steep Crypto Slide Amid Dollar Strength</h2>
            <!--Source article: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/07/ether-cardano-lead-steep-crypto-slide-amid-dollar-strength-->
            <p>Cryptocurrencies snapped an almost weeklong run above resistance levels as a strengthening dollar sent global equity and currency markets into declines.
                Ether (ETH) and Cardano's ADA have both dropped almost 9% in the past 24 hours, giving up a week's worth of gains to become the biggest decliners among major cryptocurrencies. Ether's slide came despite the activation of the Bellatrix upgrade - the Ethereum network's final "hard fork" before the Merge - on Tuesday.</p>
