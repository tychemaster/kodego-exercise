            <p>So, you might be asking me about business like, "Ano ba magandang Negosyo?"  Madalas tanong natin 'to sa mga taong alam natin na nasa negosyo and who's doing  well in this field. 
                For every successful venture, the answer to this question from what we have learned always comes from "within". What we mean is you need to "know yourself" then find something what you feel that is right for you. The answer should comes from within.
                In other word you need to think inside your box and not outside. Find something what you are passionate about. "How can you determine your passion?" it is something that "you love to do without asking for any return for doing it."
